## Subfilter project

Learn foreign languages during watching movies. But do not use common subtitles, use filtered subtitles. This Subfilter tool will filter out your subtitles. You can select difficulty options (how many words are deleted). With filtered subtitles, you need to focus more on listening, but you still have some words in subtitles for help. You will learn more in this way.

Works for most languages.
